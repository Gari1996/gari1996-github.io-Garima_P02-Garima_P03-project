    <p class="formatting">A cycling expedition in a beautiful Pink morning of the city will lead one to Nahargarh. This expedition is a major boost in the lives of the participants as it helps them to explore the fort in a very new manner by checking the details that one easily misses. The trail is little quirky due to winding roads but the view of Jaipur city and Man Sagar Lake on its way is a worth.
