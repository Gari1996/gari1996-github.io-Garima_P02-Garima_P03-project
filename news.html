    <p class="formatting">The Elephant festival of Jaipur is one of those iconic festivals that is the most endearing to all and is celebrated in an effervescent manner. However, animal rights activists have expressed concern and showed doubts about the Elephant festival so it was not held in 2013 and 2014. But now the organizers have convinced that there won’t be any harm to the elephants. So the festival is all set to spread joy among locals, tourists, and elephant lovers.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

      <p class="formatting">The last eight months have been harrowing for people across the world. The COVID-19 virus is still causing a lot of problems for the travel and hospitality industry. Travel during the pandemic surely feels a lot different, but we haven't stopped exploring, especially here in India. Jaipur's historic monuments have been attracting a large number of tourists despite the pandemic and travel restrictions.

       <span class="dance1"> The last six months saw over three lakh tourists visit Jaipur</span>, which is a large number considering the pandemic. Domestic tourism is thriving in the pink city as more Indians are looking to local destinations. International travel is still largely banned, baring the few air travel bubbles that are in place.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
